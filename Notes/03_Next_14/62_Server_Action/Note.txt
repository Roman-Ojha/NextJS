-> Server Actions are asynchronous functions that are executed on the server. They can be used in Server and Client Components to handle form submissions and data mutations in Next.js applications.
*) Convention:
    -> A Server Action can be defined with the React "use server" directive. You can place the directive at the top of an async function to mark the function as a Server Action, or at the top of a separate file to mark all exports of that file as Server Actions.
