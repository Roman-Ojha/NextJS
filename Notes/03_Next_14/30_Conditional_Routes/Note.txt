-> In case of our complex dashboard the use case would be navigating between the default list of notification and the archived list of notification
-> We have created the sub-navigation between the archived & default notification inside './src/app/complex-dashboard/@notifications' folder
-> we have list of slots on complex-dashboard:
    1. @notification
        -> only notification slot have the designated component for the archived route
        -> to prevent 404 error for the other while accessing this routes need to setup default views
    2. @revenue
    3. @users
    
-> default.tsx:
    1. './src/app/complex-dashboard/default.tsx'
        -> this will used as a fallback view for the 'children' slot
    2. './src/app/complex-dashboard/@users/default.tsx'
    2. './src/app/complex-dashboard/@revenue/default.tsx'
    
-> Now whenever we will navigate to '/complex-dashboard/archived' route then and reload the page the it will load all the default route page and only render the './src/app/complex-dashboard/@notifications/archived/page.tsx' page because we have only defined the routes for '@notification' slot section
